**Classification of the chosen fashion product into one of the 10 fashion item categories using a neural network**

## Steps: 
1. Data description: The 10 classes into one of which the input image needs to be classified are 'T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot'.
3. Data Loading 
4. Data Preprocessing (Resizing)
5. Creating the Artificial Neural Network Model
6. Hyperparameter Setting
7. Train the model
8. Evaluating the model on test dataset 
9. Make Inference using the trained model

## Model performance:
Accuracy score of the lightweight model: 87.98% (after 10 epochs)
